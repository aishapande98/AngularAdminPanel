What is AJAX?

 AJAX is Asynchronous Javascript and XML.
 AJAX is not a programming language.
 It uses combination of:
    A browser built-in XMLhttpRequest object(To request a data from the server).
    A Javascript and HTML DOM.
  AJAX updates web pages asynchronously by exchanging data with server behind the scenes. It means AJAX updates web page withour re-loading the page.
  
  
How AJAX works:
    
    An event occurs in a web page (i.e button-clicked,page is loaded).
    The XMLhttpRequest object is created by Javascript.
    XMLhttpRequest sends request to a web server.
    Server process that request.
    The server sends response back to a web page.
    The response is read by a Javascript.
    Proper action is taken by Javascript.
